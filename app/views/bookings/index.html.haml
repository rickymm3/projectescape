        Our room is built to accommodate up to 10 players.  If your group has less than 8,
        you may be paired with other players who will fill the empty spaces.
      %p
        If no one else books these spaces, you will play the game with only your group!  Keep in mind,
        the only way to ensure you have a private group is to bring 7 other friends!
